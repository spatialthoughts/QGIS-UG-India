# Purpose

The QGIS India User Group is made up of professionals, students, and volunteers from across India, working on every aspect of open-source GIS, including learning, teaching, and connecting people.

Diversity is one of our strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to when participating in this community. These rules apply equally to organisers, experienced members, and those seeking help and guidance.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended: a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the QGIS India User Group. This includes the Telegram group, mailing list, social media channels, events, and any other forums the community uses for communication.

If you violate the code of conduct, you may be banned from the forum and will be blocked from participating in future activities.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, please report it to any of the group admins at qgis-india+managers@googlegroups.com

## Code of Conduct

### Be Welcoming

We welcome people of all backgrounds, experience levels, and identities. This includes (but is not limited to) members of any race, ethnicity, culture, caste, national origin, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, family status, political belief, religion, and physical or mental ability.

### Be Considerate

Your contributions will be seen by other people, and you in turn will depend on the contributions of others. Any decision you take will affect other members, and you should take those consequences into account. Remember that we're a country-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone's primary language.

### Be Respectful

Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the community.

### Be Patient

Not everyone learns at the same pace. Not everyone has the same background. What seems obvious to you may be new to someone else. Take time to explain, and be gracious when others take time to explain things to you.

### Be careful in the words that you choose

We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Violent threats or language directed against another person
- Sexist, racist, casteist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language
- Posting sexually explicit or violent material
- Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing")
- Personal insults, especially those using discriminatory terms
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour
- Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop

### No spam
- No unsolicited promotional content or advertisements
- No repeated posting of the same content
- No off-topic job postings without prior permission from admins
- No forwarded messages, chain messages, or bulk content unrelated to GIS

### Stay within the law
- Do not share pirated software, cracked licenses, or illegal content
- Do not share copyrighted material without proper attribution or permission
- Do not use this community to facilitate any illegal activity
- Respect intellectual property rights


## When we disagree, try to understand why
Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and QGIS India User Group is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we're different. The strength of QGIS India User Group comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere. Rather, offer to help resolve issues and help learn from mistakes.


This Code of Conduct is adapted from the QGIS Project Code of Conduct.
